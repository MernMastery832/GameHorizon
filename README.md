## My Contributions  
As a **Full Stack MERN Developer**, I developed key functionalities on both the backend and frontend to ensure a smooth e-commerce experience. On the backend, I implemented **RESTful APIs** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, integrating **MongoDB** to handle user data, orders, and product inventories. I set up **JWT-based authentication** for secure user access and configured **Stripe payments** for seamless transactions. I also integrated **Cloudinary** to manage game images efficiently.  

On the frontend, I built **React components** with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a modern and visually appealing UI. I optimized state management with **Redux**, enhancing performance and scalability. Additionally, I developed advanced filtering mechanisms, a **wishlist feature**, and an **order tracking system**. Collaborating with my team, I worked alongside UI/UX designers and database engineers to refine **GameHorizonâ€™s** responsiveness, security, and overall functionality.
